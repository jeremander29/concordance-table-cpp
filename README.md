# About my Concordance Table project.
# A C++ program that creates a concordance table from a given text file.
# The program will read any text file via path of the file. you can also enter in "jingleBells.txt" to use the text file provided.
# After the file has been given, you will be prompted to enter a word that you would like to search for. There will then be a confirmation if the word exists or does not exist within the text file. You will be given the option to continue searching.
# When you are finsihed searching, the program will display a concordance of each word that is in the text file with an integer representing the amount of times it occurs. It will then exit the program.
